# SUMMARAI

An advanced AI-powered document summarization tool designed for flexible and efficient summarization of plain-text and PDF documents, leveraging modern Large Language Models (LLMs). By default, it uses the Mistral 7B model optimized for local inference.

## Overview
SUMMARAI provides an intuitive interface and backend pipeline for summarizing documents of varying lengths and formats. It supports multi-language documents, contingent on the capabilities of the underlying LLM model.

## Features
- Summarization of plain text and PDF documents
- Supports documents in any language recognized by the LLM
